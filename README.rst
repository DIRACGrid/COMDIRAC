COMDIRAC
========

Package to supply a comprehensive list of UNIX-like commands for the DIRAC user interface

Provided commands can serve several purposes:

User Client Configuration
=========================

Users can customize their client behaviour. The configuration file lies in `$HOME/.dirac/dcommands.conf`.

This file is a ConfigParser formatted file (see: http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html).

Here is a sample configuration file:

    # dcommands.conf

    # global client configuration (mainly default profile)
    [global]
    default_profile = frangrilles_user

    # frangrilles_user profile
    [frangrilles_user]
    # DIRAC group name for this profile
    group_name = frangrilles_user
    # Home directory
    home_dir = /vo.france-grilles.fr/user/p/pgay
    # default destination for commanddput
    default_se = M3PEC-disk
    # default options for command drepl
    replication_scheme = all()
    replication_ses = LAL-disk,CPPM-disk,MSFG-disk

    # other profile
    [dirac_user]
    home_dir = /
    group_name = dirac_user

It contains a `[global]` section and some named profile sections. Profiles sections are used by `dinit` command to configure session with some user profile.

commands:

* `dconfig` - get and set configuration options from configuration file

Session Environment Commands
============================

COMDIRAC sessions are built from a user profile (see User client configuration).

Sessions are used by all commands to remember client state (think of shell environment variables)

Each session is applicable to the Unix process calling the COMDIRAC command.

commands:

* `dinit` - initialize a session from a profile (with proxy creation)
* `dgetenv` - get session environment options
* `dsetenv` - set session environment options
* `dunsetenv` - delete session environment options

File Catalog Files And Directories
==================================

These commands, like others in COMDIRAC, require LFN path arguments for files and directories. These LFN paths are specified without any prefix (no "lfn:").

The main feature of these commands is to provide a sort of File Catalog "working directory" within user session. This working directory can be set and printed with dcd and dpwd, respectively. When correctly set, working directory allows user to name LFNs using relative paths.

commands:

* `dpwd` - print File Catalog working directory
* `dcd` - change File Catalog working directory
* `dls` - list File Catalog files and directories
* `dreplicas` - liste File Catalog file replicas
* `dmkdir` - create File Catalog directory
* `drmdir` - delete File Catalog directory


Data Management
===============

These commands, like others in COMDIRAC, require LFN path arguments for files and directories. These LFN paths are specified without any prefix (no "lfn:").

When a local path is needed, as with dget or dput, it is deduced from command context. For example, local path is last argument with command dget, while it is first with dput.

commands:

* `dput` - register local file in the File Catalog (and copies replica to a Storage Element)
* `dget` - retrieves a local copy of a File Catalog file
* `drm` - remove a file from the File Catalog (and all associated replicas)
* `drepl` - replicates a File Catalog file
* `dchmod` - change access rights of a File Catalog file

File Catalog Metadata Management
================================

commands:
* `dmeta` - manipulates File Catalog metadata
* `dfind` - find files with File Catalog metadata

Jobs Management
===============

commands:

* `dinput` - retrieve input sandbox for a DIRAC job
* `dkill` - kill or delete DIRAC job
* `dlogging` - retrieve logging information for a DIRAC job
* `doutput` - retrieve output sandbox for a DIRAC job
* `dstat` - retrieve status of DIRAC jobs
* `dsub` - submit jobs to DIRAC WMS
